Sample Output

The program should display a list of all of the words found in the text along with the number of
occurrences of that word. Words that are used only once should be listed separately after all those
that appear multiple times. Note that this does not mean the words have to be sorted (see below). Capitalization
and punctuation should be ignored; i.e., “Hello” is the same word as “hello.” For example, if the
input was:

Text File:
Computer Science is swell. The computer is my pal.
Is it yours? DONE

The output would be something like:

Word Number of Occurrences
===================================
is 3
computer 2
Words with one occurrence
===================================
science swell the my pal it yours
